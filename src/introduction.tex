Introduction related to data quality


The application aims to help journal editors, conference and workshop chairs on identifying suitable reviewers for a particular paper, by providing a nice visualization of related authors and papers. To this end, the pilot relies on an innovative social network visualization, namely Collaboration Spheres. 

In a nutshell the Collaboration Spheres provide a mechanism to improve, share and reuse research papers and author experiences information based on the exploitation of semantic descriptions, relations and similarities between research papers and authors.
