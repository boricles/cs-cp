In this article we present a system description for a visual metaphor called Collaboration Spheres which allow search through exploration of scientific social networks based on a combination of people and information objects. This search paradigm is built around the use of customizable contexts that act as intuitive examples conducted by the users. This tool eases collaboration, expert finding and access to relevant information.

The presented application aims to help journal editors, conference and workshop chairs on identifying suitable reviewers for a particular paper, by providing a nice visualization of related authors and papers. To this end, the pilot relies on an innovative social network visualization, namely Collaboration Spheres. 

In a nutshell the Collaboration Spheres provide a mechanism to improve, share and reuse research papers and author experiences information based on the exploitation of semantic descriptions, relations and similarities between research papers and authors.
