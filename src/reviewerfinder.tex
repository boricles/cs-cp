The Reviewer finder is illustrated by the APA prototype that we have developed. It consists on a web application that covers the process of finding a good reviewer for a specific article or publication. The whole process is driven by the actions performed by the user while creating different contexts towards his final objective. Each action allows the modification of the search parameters in an intuitive way and offers summaries of information that may help on understanding the available resources.\\

The user interface has been designed in order to keep a minimalist layout that makes user experience smooth and simple. This simplicity does not waive the content needed by te users in the aim of getting the desired results. The main part of the screen displays a set of concentric circles that serve both as a playground to customize the search and as a front of the most relevant results of the search. 
The center of the circles contains the article for which we are looking for reviewers. The immediate adjacent circle is the place where the user can define different contexts (each context created is equivalent to a search) by adding and removing authors and articles. The two external circles collect the most relevant reviewers that the system has found in order to tackle the main article together with the context that surrounds it.
Other aspect that is covered by the Collaboration Spheres is the usage of a code of colors and warning icons when showing the results on the circles. The colors follow the traffic-light metaphor, where green represents the best reviewers, yellow is used for other good reviewers and red is used for the less (but still) recommended reviewers. As we evaluate possible conflicts between the reviewers and the article to be reviewed, we are able to warn the users by adding a warning icon for those recommendations where conflict has been detected (author, previous co-author or same organization are examples of conflicts in our scenario). 
On the right of the screen there are two different columns that gather three distinct lists each. The first column focuses on authors at different levels: the first level shows the main authors of the article, the second level shows other authors that had collaborated with the main authors in previous publications, and the third level presents a set of relevant authors whose work share one or more topics with the main article. A parallel approach has been taken for the second column which focuses on articles at three different levels: the first level shows other articles authored by the main authors,  the second level shows articles authored by previous co-authors, and the third level presents a set of relevant articles that have related topics with the main article. Every element from the lists is draggable and can be dropped at the circles. The drag-and-drop action allows the user to create their customized context in the Collaboration Spheres.
Every time that a new element is added to the context, a cloud of tags that is placed under the circles gets updated. This cloud of tags represents the key topics for the created contexts and provides an informative abstraction of the search at a simple glance. Some of the elements at the cloud of tags are a link to their corresponding URIs at Wikipedia.
Apart from that, it is worth to mention that every element is clickable in order to get a summary of its contents, together with the link to the resource itself in the VIVO platform enhancing the users exploration. A twitter search for the most relevant topics of every element is provided with the intention of adding a nice feature of pointing topic appearance in social networks.\\
