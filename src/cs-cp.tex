\begin{abstract}
Science is incremental and cyclic. New breakthroughs are built on top of previous results which will themselves be the basis for future developments once validated by peer scientists and accepted for publication in scholarly communications. However, the process of identifying suitable reviewers for a particular article can be cumbersome and costly. Not only do journal editors need to have a thorough, personal knowledge of their journals and the members of the community who can be suitable reviewers but also they must have an eye for spotting potential conflicts of interest that may raise biased reviews. Thus, means are required that assist editors in order to identify suitable reviewers amongst members of scientific communities. In this paper we present an expert finding system based on the application of the Collaboration Spheres search-by-example visual interface, to the case of the American Psychologic Association, a publishing body with over 70 journals, 54 interest groups, and 134,000 members, including researchers, educators, clinicians, consultants and students. We show how we enriched APA's previously existing RDF data model and produced an extended dataset which explicitly materializes the relationships between authors, articles, and their organizations. Based on this dataset we describe a service layer implemented as a set of SPARQL queries which feeds the Collaboration Spheres interface and enables the required expert finding capabilities.
