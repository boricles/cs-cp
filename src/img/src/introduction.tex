Research is intended for the betterment of society and the world, and science is incremental. Important discoveries and developments are built on top of previous research efforts, which are validated by peer scientists and accepted for publication in scholarly communications. However, the process of identifying experts in a particular field, which can be suitable reviewers for a particular article can be cumbersome and costly.

In this paper, we describe the system that aims to help journal editors, conference and workshop chairs on identifying suitable reviewers for a particular paper, by providing a nice visualization of related authors and papers. To this end, the system relies on an innovative social network visualization, namely Collaboration Sphere, CSs. 

In a nuthshell, the visual metaphor called Collaboration Spheres allow search through exploration of scientific social networks based on a combination of people and information objects. This search paradigm is built around the use of customizable contexts that act as intuitive examples conducted by the users. This tool eases collaboration, expert finding and access to relevant information.

It is worth mentioning that in this case we plug the Collaboration Spheres over the APA enriched dataset, but the CSs are customizable and they can plug to other datasets, coming from different domains, with minor configuration changes.
